      'Pope John Paul II (Saint) in his Post-Synodal Apostolic Exhortation Christi Fideles Laici, on the vocation and the mission of the lay faithful in the Church and in the world, explains "Who are the lay faithful", and their mission in the Church. The document explains the unique character of the vocation of the laity, which is in a special way to "seek the Kingdom of God by engaging in temporal affairs and ordering them according to the plan of God.',
      'The document also explains The Lay Faithfull\'s Participation in the Life of the Church, in particular Church, in the diocese in which "the Church of Christ, one, holy, catholic and apostolic, is truly present and at work". It is in this document that Group Forms of Participation In the mission of the Church are explained as associations, groups, communities and movements. While speaking on women, the document exhorts women to participate more',

      "The purpose of this book is to harmonise the formation of Catholic Women Association in the Archdiocese of Nairobi. Parishes should use facilitators (TOT) who have been given an orientation on how to facilitate discussions among members in their parishes and deaneries.",
      "The book will also help the parish leaders identify outside facilitators to handle some of the topics.",
      "It is anticipated that members will fully participate in the discussions, sharing their experiences, reading and sharing the bible readings.",
      "The book has suggested many Bible verses which cannot all be covered during parish meetings and seminars. Members are encouraged to read and reflect on quoted Bible verses on their own.",
      "They are also encouraged to read many other relevant books on Catholic faith.",

      "New members should be given opportunity to reflect and share their motivation for joining CWA and to state their expectations.",
      'Since it is a call from God and the Church, all women are encouraged to respond to this call by joining the CWA. As in Psalms 421-2 which says "As the deer longs for streams of water, so my soul longs for you". CWA members should desire to meet God. CWA members like other baptized Christians are called to worship God in their daily activities because they have been called to do so as commissioned at baptism and for different ministries in the Church. In Joel2:13, the Lord asks us "to render our hearts not our garments and return to the Lord your God". Therefore CWA members are called to cry with David (Ps51:13)" Do not cast me from your presence nor take from me your Holy Spirit"',
